# Flappy Bird Game

Welcome to my implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game, built using the Unity game engine!

## Game Description
Flappy Bird is a simple yet addictive game where you control a bird and navigate it through a series of pipes without crashing. The goal is to pass as many pipes as possible to achieve a high score.

## Features
- **Simple Controls:** Tap or click to make the bird fly higher.
- **Randomly Generated Pipes:** Each playthrough is unique with randomly generated pipe positions.
- **Scoring System:** Keep track of your high score and challenge yourself to beat it.
- **Game Over Screen:** Displays your score and high score after each game.
